# Spacee Invaders Game
For my first project I will be attempting to make my own version of the classic 70s video game using and testing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScrip.  

## Description
* A simple single player game where the objective is to shoot down all the opposing objects”invaders”.
* The invaders are represented by several rows of objects that move side to side and drop down.
* The player acts as the “shooter” at the bottom of the game space. The shooter can only shoot up and is fixd to the bottom but like the invaders can also move side to side the width of the screen.
