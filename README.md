# Spacee Invaders Game
For my first project I will be attempting to make my own version of the classic 70s video game using and testing my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScrip.  

## Description
* A simple single player game where the objective is to shoot down all the opposing objects”invaders”.
* The invaders are represented by several rows of objects that move side to side and drop down.
* The player acts as the “shooter” at the bottom of the game space. The shooter can only shoot up and is fixd to the bottom but like the invaders can also move side to side the width of the screen.

## What went well 
* Creating the board.
* Shoter motion 
* Projectile motion 

## What did not
* Getting the logic working for all the pieces took time and the project needed to be scaled down.  Decided to keep the 'invader' objects fiixed for now.

## What I would like to do next 
* What I would like to add in the near future is a timer element.  So all objects must be hit before time runs out. A second level were the invader objects shoot back.
* Farther down the road I would like to build the full Space Invaders game with functionsing invader objects.
